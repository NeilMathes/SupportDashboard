#CUSI Support Dashboard

The CUSI Support Dashboard queries ticket data from [FootPrints Service Core](http://www.bmc.com/it-solutions/footprints-service-core.html) and displays it in [Dashing by Shopify](http://shopify.github.io/dashing/).  This repository provides an example of integrating Dashing with a T-SQL backend.
